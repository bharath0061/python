>>> a=1
>>> b=2
>>> c=3
>>> print ("{0} + {1} + {2} = {3}".format(a,b,c, a+b+c))
1 + 2 + 3 = 6
>>> print (f"value of a is {a}\nvalue of b is {b}\nvalue of c is {c}")
value of a is 1
value of b is 2
value of c is 3

Fomatted string: Using f we can write formatted string by directly calling variable within the flower braces. Below are the examples.

>>> print (f"sum of a + b + c = {a+b+c}") ==> 
sum of a + b + c = 6
>>> print (f"{a} + {b} + {c} = {a+b+c}")
1 + 2 + 3 = 6
