Return: "return" method is used to assing the result of a method to a variable.

>>> def product_of_numbers(a,b,c):
	mult = a * b * c ==> At first Assign the result to a varible
	return mult      ==> Then use return method fallowing with the above varible which can the value and assing to given variable while using the function. 

>>> result = product_of_numbers(2,3,4) ==> Here we are using method and return value is assigning to varible "result"
>>> result
24
>>> product_of_numbers(2,3,4)
24
>>> def angle_of_triangle(first_angl, second_angl):
	third_angl = 180 - first_angl + second_angl
	return third_angl

>>> result = angle_of_triangle(30,60)
>>> result
210
>>> def angle_of_triangle(first_angl, second_angl):
	third_angl = 180 - first_angl - second_angl
	return third_angl

>>> result = angle_of_triangle(30,60)
>>> result
90
>>> def sum_of_three_num(a,b,c):
	return a + b + c  ==> In return function you can use expression for arthamatic operations as well

>>> result = sum_of_three_num(2,3,4)
>>> result
9
>>> result * 10
90
